Today I'm starting up this blog to detail my efforts at making money online. I'm going to keep track of what and do and how much I earn doing it. Over the next few weeks or months I plan to explore many different methods of earning money online.

My initial experiments are with sites that pay you for doing certain tasks. It can be watching ads, filling out surveys or clicking on links. These are the simplest places to start making money as all you have to do is sign up and start. How much can be earned from these remains to be seen.
