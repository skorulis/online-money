Still recovering from my hard disk loss which is eating up time getting everything running back how I expect it to. During my research into spam score I found [Google webmaster tools](https://www.google.com/webmasters/). I'm getting all of my sites setup now as the results don't start recording until you do. It seems like there's a fair bit of insight to be had there.
