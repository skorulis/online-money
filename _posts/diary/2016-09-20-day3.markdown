Got a rejection letter from UserTesting. Apparently my sample video wasn't up to scratch. At least it's letting me take the test again so that avenue isn't lost. It's nice as well that it didn't make me wait a week to get the results there.

Found an offer from [ING](https://www.campaigns.ingdirect.com.au/refer?cid=ccm:rdl:oeraf:ref) to get $75 for creating a new account and depositing $1000. Couldn't pass up a generous offer. I'm still waiting on confirmation that I'm getting the reward
