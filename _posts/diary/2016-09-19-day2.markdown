[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/p/register?rb=21823318) had an offer of $5 when spending $2.20 on a lottery ticket. I don't expect to get anything from the lottery but regardless I'm still ahead

I setup an old phone today running perkTV. It's a shitty old Android that barely functions but manages to run the app fine so I'm going to leave it going and see how much it can earn

Estimated earnings: $8
