What is this guide?
-----

This guide is about how to get attention online. Not just attention but how to get the people you want to go where you want. In most cases this will be about how to get your target audience to your website. I'm going to go light on how to get them to do what you want once they're there as the topic I've chosen is already large enough.

This is for people who want to get the maximum effect in the minimum time. It's going to skip over a lot of the in depth.

If you happen to be reading this now treat this as a beta version of the guide. It's going to take multiple revisions to get it right and will evolve over time.


Why am I writing this?
-------

Because when I started this guide my site had 0 vistors. The fact that you're reading this means in some way I must have succeeded in my goal. As I'm writing this I probably know less about online marketing than you do. But I know that in order to get the traffic I need to create a sustainable business I have to learn how to market myself and my business online.

Case studies
--------

As I develop this guide I will also develop 2 sites. The first is [Positly](https://positly.com) which I recently launched but has very little traffic. The second is the [skorulis.com domain](https://skorulis.com) which I've had for a long time but is mostly for personal information. When appropriate I'll discuss how I achieved my goals for these 2 sites and allow you to watch them grow.
