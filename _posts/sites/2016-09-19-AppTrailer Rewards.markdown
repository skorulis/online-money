NEED TO CHECK THIS

AppTrailer rewards shows app trailer videos. Very simple. 


Ways to earn
---

* Watching videos: 5 credits per video
* 50 credits when one of your referrals cashes out.

Overall
-----

* The app crashes quite often after playing a video. The rewards for watching a video are much less than other apps. It's nice that you can watch unlimited videos but having to press a button after each isn't worth the effort.
