Swagbucks is a good looking site that offers a number of ways to earn money.


Ways to earn
---

* Get around 120 SB by completing all the bits and pieces during sign up
* Surveys: Get on average 75SB per survey.
* Shopping: Cashback for various retailers ranging from 1%-9%
* Videos: Earn 1SB - 3SB for watching 6-20 short videos
* TV: Looping channels that play in a separate window. Earns about 3 SB every 25 minutes
* Games: Up to 25SB for playing games
* Apps: Up to 150SB for download apps
* Search: I got 20SB for the first search but am yet to see anything after this
* Daily search 5SB



Sweeps
----

* There are various sweeps that can be entered by spending the SB you've earned. I haven't tried these yet as it seems counterproductive to gamble the money that I've just earned.

Daily rewards
----

* 10% bonus at 30 SB and 80 SB
* Get increasing rewards up to 300SB for reaching the earning goal each day.

Referral bonus
--------

* Get 10% as a bonus for the earnings of anyone you refer.


Overall
-------

* Swagbucks is a pleasant site to use but there isn't much in the way of earning potential. The surveys give decent rewards but are time consuming to complete. There's some good app download deals but they don't come up that often. There's a lot of daily videos to watch which are enough to reach the daily goals
