* Neilsen mobile runs in the background and does some sort of monitoring. It has some very strange steps when you install the app (at least on iPhones) which I probably wouldn't trust from another company.


Ways to earn
---

* Just setup the app and let it run. There's nothing else to do.


Overall
-------

* The concept seems nice an passive but it's hard to get a feel for how much it's earning. I'm going to give it a few more days before I call this one.
