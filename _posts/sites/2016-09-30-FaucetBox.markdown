Faucet box isn't a single site but a list of bitcoin faucets. When you go to a faucet it shows a bunch of spammy ads asks for a bitcoin address and requires solving a captcha. In exchange it puts a small amount of your chose crypto currency into your faucetbox account. But these amounts are ridiculously small, less than a 10th of a cent.

On the upside you can cashout very small amounts which will take up to 48 hours. If you need a few cents of a crypto currency for some reason it would make sense to use, otherwise it's a waste of time.

And when I say spammy ads I mean spammy. The kind that redirects you while opening up a new window with alerts and all that garbage.
