Ways to earn
---

* 250 HC for signing up
* Search: 4 HC for performing a search, resets hourly
* Surveys: These bounce all over the place between different providers. It makes it a bit difficult to understand what's going on. I filled out the same initial questions 10 times without ever finding a survey which I was able to complete
* Videos: Couldn't find any it would let me watch
* HulkTV: 25 HC for 5 videos. There were none available for me unfortunately

Referral bonus

Overall
-------

* Having HC worth so little means you feel like you're earning a lot when in reality it's very little.
* Seems like some of the offers are broken
* Some offers seem very untrustworthy
