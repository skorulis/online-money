* Has a huge family of apps. No idea why it needs so many and the constant changing between them gets really confusing.

Ways to earn
---

* 100 points on startup
* Offerwall
* Videos: 2-4 PP per video. Leaving videos playing on a device works well but you get no credit for watching in a browser.
* Shopping rewards


Overall
-------

* PerkTV offers one of the best passive video watching experiences. Some sites say that you can run up to 5 devices at once but there's no mention on perkTV about this and some users have had their account locked when they try to redeem. 

If you have an old device you can install the app on you can leave it running all day. In Australia the payment is 50% of what people get in the US but it can still generate $0.20 a day.
