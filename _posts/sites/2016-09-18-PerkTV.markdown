* Has a huge family of apps. No idea why it needs so many and the constant changing between them gets really confusing.


Ways to earn
---

* 100 points on startup
* Videos: 2-4 PP per video. Leaving videos playing on a device works well but you get no credit for watching in a browser


Overall
-------

* Installing the app on a device and letting it run all day will generate a modest income.
