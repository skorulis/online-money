Ways to earn
------

* <b>Sign up:</b> Multiple questions and tutorials paying around $0.05 and helping tailor the site to you
* <b>Surveys:</b> Gives $0.05 - $0.10 when you don't qualify which is nice. Payouts for completing a survey are usually over $1.

Referrals
-------

$2 per referral when they complete over 10 activities.

Overall
------

The minimum cash out is a bit steep but it's a really nice site. It suffers from the same issues as other sites that the surveys are external so sometimes ask repetitive questions but they seem to be of a higher quality.
