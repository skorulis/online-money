Ways to earn
---

* <b>Signup:</b> 28 points for completing sign up tasks
* <b>Tasks:</b> Via crowdflower
* <b>Videos:</b> The videos don't play for me but it still pays out 2 points for every 6 videos I click the play button on. This runs out pretty quickly.
* <b>Surveys:</b> All via the offerwall, haven't bothered with them yet.

Overall

The site is nice to use but there aren't that many opportunities open to me.
