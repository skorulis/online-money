UserTesting is a little different. You record a video and screen capture as you navigate a site. When you sign up you have to complete an initial test. Once I had completed this I was told there was a week long wait before I would be notified if I had access. After only a day though I was told that I had not passed.


I'm still waiting to get access to the site so I can't give any more information.
