I got as far as signing up and then my account was locked for unknown reasons. I've sent them an email about this which hasn't gotten a reply, I replied to their welcome email (which specifically asked for that) but the email couldn't be delivered and I tweeted to them. 

I don't know why I've been banned but it's pretty poor form to send me an email asking if I need help and then not replying to any of my requests for help. I might just sign up with a different email address.
