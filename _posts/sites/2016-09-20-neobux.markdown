* Neobux focuses around pay to click ads. 


Ways to earn
---

* Clicking on an ad pays $0.001
* Tasks via crowdflower
* After clicking on ads you gain a number of "AdPrize" entries. Basically they let you view an ad with a chance to win a prize. I'm yet to win anything in this regard

* Similar in layout and operation to [Clixsense](/site/Clixsense.html)


Overall
-------

* This could be ok if the PTC rates weren't so low or if there were more. As it is now there's only the opportunity to make about $0.02 a day.
