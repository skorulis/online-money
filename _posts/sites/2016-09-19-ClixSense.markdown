Clixsense has pay to click ads as well as surveys


Ways to earn
---

* PTC ads. Earn up to $0.01 for clicking on the ad and waiting the required amount of time. The countdown stops if you leave the page so you have to physically watch the ad
* Tasks via crowdflower
* Offerwall
* Surveys. There's no reward for surveys that you do not qualify for which can waste a lot of time just getting through the initial questions
* Clixgrid -> Like PTC ads but you don't know what ad you're going to get and only gives you a chance to win. In 35 attempts I am yet to win anything


Overall
------

The PTC are nice but there aren't enough to make decent earnings.
