Clixsense has pay to click ads as well as surveys


Ways to earn
---

* <b>PTC ads:</b> Earn up to $0.01 for clicking on the ad and waiting the required amount of time. The countdown stops if you leave the page so you have to physically watch the ad.
* <b>Tasks</b> via crowdflower
* Offerwall
* <b>Surveys</b> There's no reward for surveys that you do not qualify for which can waste a lot of time just getting through the initial questions
* <b>Clixgrid</b> -> Like PTC ads but you don't know what ad you're going to get and only gives you a chance to win. In 275 attempts I am yet to win anything


Overall
------

The PTC are a less common feature but they pay way too little. You're better off just staying away from this site.
