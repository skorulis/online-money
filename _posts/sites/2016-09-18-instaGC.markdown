Ways to earn
---

* <b>Sign up:</b> 10 points for signing up
* <b>Search:</b> Search randomly gives 5 points every now and again. It's hard to say how frequent this is. If you don't earn from another source then search stops paying out.
* <b>Videos:</b> Never finds any videos to watch

Referral bonus
--------

* 10 points per referral + 10% of what they earn


Overall
-------

* So far I've gotten very little from InstaGC. Everything that looks like it might be a good deal ends up giving me nothing
