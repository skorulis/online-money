Ways to earn
---

* 10 points for signing up
* Search: Search randomly gives 5 points every now and again. It's hard to say how frequent this is
* Videos: Never finds any videos to watch

Referral bonus
--------

* 10 points per referral + 10% of what they earn


Overall
-------

* So far I've gotten very little from InstaGC. Everything that looks like it might be a good deal ends up giving me nothing
